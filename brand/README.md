# Brand Guidelines Workspace

This directory replaces the previous DOCX-based guidelines with Markdown files that are easy to diff, review, and version. It now hosts the live Critical Start brand documentation.

## Structure
- `brand-guidelines.md` – master guidance covering the brand platform, messaging, tone, and governance prompts with approved copy.
- `visual-identity.md` – visual system specifications (logos, color, typography, layout, accessibility, downloadable assets) aligned to the brand identity manual.

## How to Update
1. Edit the relevant Markdown section and keep tables aligned for readability.
2. Link to any binary design assets stored under `assets/` or an approved CDN.
3. Update the \"Revision History\" sections so stakeholders know what changed and when.
4. If new visual assets are produced, add them to the inventory table with file paths.
