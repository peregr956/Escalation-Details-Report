# Brand Guidelines Workspace

This directory replaces the previous DOCX-based guidelines with Markdown files that are easier to diff, review, and version. Use these templates as the single source of truth for Critical Start's brand documentation.

## Structure
- `brand-guidelines.md` – master guidance covering the brand platform, messaging, voice, and governance. References deeper dives where needed.
- `visual-identity.md` – visual system specifications (logos, color, typography, layout, accessibility, downloadable assets).

## How to Update
1. Paste or write the latest approved guidance into the relevant sections.
2. Keep tables aligned and use existing headings to maintain consistency.
3. Link to any binary design assets stored under `assets/` or an approved CDN.
4. Update the "Revision History" sections so stakeholders know what changed and when.

Once you provide the finalized content, we can replace the placeholder text with the official copy.
